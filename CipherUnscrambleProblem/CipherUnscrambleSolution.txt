Solution:

You first need to read the text I give with the ciphered flag, which states "DO try your best to decode this key: ".
The word DO is made to look like that for a reason, that is what the flag was ciphered by.
More specifically, the first letter of the Caesar Ciphered flag is shifted by 4 (since D is the 4th letter) and the next letter is shifted by 15 (since O is the 15th letter).
Once you uncipher that part, all that is left is the Caesar Cipher, which was shifted by 1826 (CWRU founding year).
From there, you should have the actual flag, which is CASEWesternReserveUCiphered
